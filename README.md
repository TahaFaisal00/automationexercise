# Automation Exercise — Robot Framework Test Suite

End-to-end **UI and API** test automation for [automationexercise.com](https://automationexercise.com), built with Robot Framework on a strict three-layer architecture (Tests → Resources → Page Objects).

## Overview

This suite tests a live e-commerce demo site across two interfaces — the browser UI and the public REST API — plus full end-to-end user journeys that span both. It covers positive flows, negative flows, and **bug-documenting tests** that capture known defects in the target site without breaking the build.

The point of the repo is not just coverage. It's the architecture: every locator, every wait, and every business assertion has exactly one place it is allowed to live, enforced consistently across ~20 files.

## Architecture

A three-layer design with one rule per layer. Responsibilities never leak across boundaries.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Tests<br/>UITests · APITests · E2E_Tests<br/><i>what to verify — assertions live here</i>"]
    B["Resources / Res<br/>automationexercise_Res · API_RES<br/><i>business & workflow keywords</i>"]
    C["Page Objects (PO)<br/>HomePage · ProductsPage · CartPage · ...<br/><i>physical interactions + sync-waits + locators</i>"]
    D["Test Data<br/>TestData · API_TestData<br/><i>business values only</i>"]

    A --> B --> C
    B -.reads.-> D
```

**The rules that hold the suite together:**

- **Sync-waits vs. business assertions never mix.** A sync-wait inside a Page Object proves an action *landed* (the page is ready). A business assertion in the test layer proves a *requirement* was met. They are different jobs and live in different layers.
- **Locators and paths live inside Page Objects.** Business values live in test data files. A locator never appears in a test; a hard-coded business value never appears in a Page Object.
- **No single-call pass-through wrappers** in the Resource layer — a keyword earns its place by doing real composition.
- **Dictionaries are unpacked at the Resource boundary** and never enter a Page Object.

## Test coverage

**UI (`Tests/UITests.robot`)**
Login/logout, registration and account deletion, invalid-credential login, product review, cart deletion, search by name, search with invalid input, and category/brand filtering. Includes bug-documenting tests for the cart quantity field (non-editable field, negative quantities, negative price).

**API (`Tests/APITests/`)** — grouped by resource:
Brands List, Products List, Search Product, User Account, and Verify Login. Each file covers positive paths and negative paths (wrong HTTP method, missing fields, invalid credentials).

**End-to-end (`Tests/E2E_Tests/`)** — journeys that exercise the full stack:
- `Registered User Completes Purchase` — login through checkout and payment.
- `Guest Converts To Registered And Purchases` — guest checkout that converts to a registered account mid-flow.
- `Full Account Lifecycle - Create Login Delete Then Login Fails` — pure-API lifecycle asserting that a deleted account can no longer authenticate.

---

## Tagging strategy

Tests are tagged on four axes so any slice can be run on demand:

- **Layer** — `ui`, `api`, `e2e`
- **Type** — `functional`, `bug`
- **Expectation** — `positive`, `negative`
- **Resource / method** (API) — `useraccounts`, `brandslist`, `productslist`, `searchproducts`, `verifylogin`, plus `get` / `post` / `put` / `delete`

```bash
robot --include api AND positive Tests/        # only happy-path API tests
robot --exclude bug Tests/                      # skip known-defect tests
robot --include useraccounts Tests/APITests/    # everything touching the account resource
```

---

## Bug-documenting tests

Some tests deliberately assert the target site's **actual broken behavior** rather than the correct behavior, tagged `bug` with an inline comment stating *expected vs. actual*. This keeps CI green while still pinning the defect: if the site is ever fixed, the test fails loudly and tells you the bug is gone. It is a record of known issues, not a source of false failures.

## Running the suite

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.14 and Google Chrome.


---

## CI/CD

The full 42-test suite runs in a Jenkins declarative pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`): checkout → dependency install → headless execution → Robot Framework result publishing.

**Pipeline stages**
![Jenkins pipeline stages](docs/images/jenkins-stage-view.png)

**Latest run — 42/42 passing, with trend and per-suite breakdown**
![Robot Framework results](docs/images/jenkins-robot-results.png)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install robotframework robotframework-seleniumlibrary robotframework-requests robotframework-faker

# 2. Run everything
robot Tests/

# 3. Run a single suite
robot Tests/UITests.robot
robot Tests/APITests/
robot Tests/E2E_Tests/

# 4. Run headless (for CI)
robot --variable HEADLESS:True Tests/
```

Results are written to `output.xml`, `log.html`, and `report.html` in the working directory.
